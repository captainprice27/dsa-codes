> ### ***i >> j***
This means "shift the bits of i to the right by j positions."

Example: If i is 13 (binary 1101) and j is 2, then i >> j means shifting the bits of 1101 right by 2 positions.
Binary 1101 becomes 0011 (or 3 in decimal).

> ### ***j >> i***

This means "shift the bits of j to the right by i positions."

Example: If j is 13 (binary 1101) and i is 2, then j >> i means shifting the bits of 1101 right by 2 positions.
Binary 1101 becomes 0011 (or 3 in decimal).
> ### ***i << j***    
This means "shift the bits of i to the left by j positions."

Example: If i is 13 (binary 1101) and j is 2, then i << j means shifting the bits of 1101 left by 2 positions.
Binary 1101 becomes 110100 (or 52 in decimal).
> ### ***j << i***
This means "shift the bits of j to the left by i positions."

Example: If j is 13 (binary 1101) and i is 2, then j << i means shifting the bits of 1101 left by 2 positions.
Binary 1101 becomes 110100 (or 52 in decimal).
Summary of Bitwise Shift Operations
i >> j: Right shift the bits of i by j positions.
j >> i: Right shift the bits of j by i positions.
i << j: Left shift the bits of i by j positions.
j << i: Left shift the bits of j by i positions.
